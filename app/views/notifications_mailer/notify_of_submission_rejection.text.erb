Hello!

Thank you so much for taking the time and energy to submit a session for Denver Startup Week <%= Date.today.year %>!

Unfortunately, the session "<%= @submission.title %>" was not chosen.

The selection process is always difficult as we receive hundreds of amazing submissions like yours. This year was even more challenging as 2020 will consist of fewer, shorter and more concentrated sessions.

However, we would still love for you to be involved! We value you as a community member and would love to provide more options for you to be involved beyond submitting sessions.
