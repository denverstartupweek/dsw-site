Hello!

Congratulations! Your session "<%= @submission.title %>" has been selected to be part of the <%= @submission.track.name %> Track program during Denver Startup Week <%= Date.today.year %>.

This year will be filled with fewer, shorter, and more concentrated sessions that keep online audiences tuned in and engaged.

<%- if @submission.preferred_length.present? -%>
With both the opportunities and considerations of this year’s virtual event, we have assigned you a slot of <%= @submission.preferred_length %>.
<%- end %>

<%- if @submission.time_assigned? -%>
We’ve scheduled it for <%= @submission.start_datetime.strftime('%A %B %e') %> at <%= @submission.human_start_time %>.
<%- else %>
We have not scheduled it for a timeslot yet but will be doing so shortly.
<%- end %>

We know this is a lengthy email but please read all of the following information as there are important, mandatory steps and dates which will require action from you.

Please reply to this email to let us know (as soon as you are able, but no later than EOD <%= (Date.today + 4.days).strftime('%A %B %-e') %>) that you’re willing and able to present this session for the time allotted above. If you are not able to present for that time, please let us know. Due to the nature of the virtual event, we have very limited ability to accommodate requests for time changes. If we don’t receive confirmation from you by the date above, we will cede your slot to another session.


SESSION LOGISTICS

More information about your session date and time will be provided over the next week or two as we finalize the schedule. DSW will be handling online streaming capabilities so you do not need to provide your own virtual platform.

Please note that all 10 minute and 30 minute sessions will be pre-recorded while 60 minute sessions will be streamed live.

Stay tuned for more information!


TITLE & DESCRIPTION UPDATES

We have created a section of the site where you can submit updates to the title and description for your session. Make sure your title is short and intuitive. Double check that your description is succinct and communicates what your audience will take away. Also, check that panelists are listed in the "description" field (visible), versus the "notes" field (not visible). For more information, visit https://www.denverstartupweek.org/voting/mine and follow the instructions there.

We will be announcing the full schedule and opening registration for attendees in mid-August, so we encourage you to get your updates in as soon as possible. You can preview what your session detail page will look like at <%= schedule_url(@submission) %> (though please note that registration and schedule building are not yet active).


VIRTUAL MANDATORY PRESENTER ORIENTATION

To help ensure consistency and ease logistics for all our sessions, we ask that all session organizers attend one of our orientation sessions. The sessions cover event logistics, volunteer coordination, session promotion, branding, and more. We’re offering the session at two different times (once during the business day and once in the evening) to try to accommodate as many schedules as possible.

We are still finalizing dates for these sessions, and will be in touch as soon as we have them dialed in.


OTHER EVENTS

We will have other virtual events throughout the week and would love to see you take part in some of them. The full schedule will be publicized and registration will open in just a few weeks.


GET FURTHER INVOLVED

For information on how you can get further involved in Denver Startup Week, head over to our website (www.denverstartupweek.org) and go to the Get Involved page to sign up to receive specific updates on happenings like the Job Fair & Showcase, volunteering, and sponsorship opportunities.


Per the above, please reply back as soon as possible to confirm you are still willing and able to host this virtual session. We will be in touch with you over the next week or so with additional details.
